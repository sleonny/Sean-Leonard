# Web Developer Profile Page for Sean Leonard

## Description

I needed a profile page to show potential employers my work and let them get to know me a little.
I began by creating the html code.  I added the header and then built each section.  I added a nav bar 
with links to the section on the page.  Next I added a short paragraph about me and my excitement
for learning this field and private details about my life.  Next I used grid css to put three projects
and a coming soon box to highlight my work.  Under that I built a footer section to have contact information
so that potential employers can see my linkedin, github and contact me by email.  

Next I added CSS elements to the html sections.  I downloaded a template to write and upload my own
handwriting and added that to the css sheet to give it a personal touch.  Then I styled the sections
and elements of the html using mostly flex.  It was difficult to get everything positioned correctly
within the grid boxes but I learned a lot getting it to work.  

Finally I added a pseudo-element to make the first project img to grow a little when hovered
over.  I then commented out the code so that other developers are able to see my thought process
or I can understand at a later time what I was thinking.
