        <header>Howdy!  My name is Sean and I currently am a student of a full stack web development bootcamp.
         My mid-life crisis turned out to be a career change and I am loving everything so far about web
         development.  "So far" is only HTML, CSS & a little bit of Javascript however the road ahead looks 
         amazing and could it be you hiring me I see at the end of it?  I certainly hope so and very much look
         forward to meeting you and discussing how I could be an asset to your company.  If you're thinking
         I may not be a good fit for a job but look like a fun and interesting guy, you're right!  My go to fun fact 
         about myself is that I was born on Christmas Day so the Santa in the picture doesn't seem so random now huh?  
         If you were compelled to you could find me in my spare time watching a European soccer game with my wife and 
         two dogs possibly planning our next trip somewhere in the world, tinkering with things
         I don't understand out in the garage or lately just playing around with Chrome devtools to see what
         all is possible.
