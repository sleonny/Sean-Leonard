    <header>Howdy! My name is Sean and I currently am a student of a full stack web development bootcamp.
      My mid-life crisis turned out to be a career change and I am loving everything so far about web
      development. "So far" is only HTML, CSS & a little bit of Javascript, however the road ahead looks
      amazing and could it be you hiring me I see at the end of it? I certainly hope so and very much look
      forward to meeting you and discussing how I could be an asset to your company. If you're thinking
      I may not be a good fit for a job but look like a fun and interesting guy, you're right! My go to fun fact
      about myself is that I was born on Christmas Day so the Santa in the picture isn't all that random.
      If you were compelled to you could find me in my spare time watching a European soccer game with my wife and
      two dogs possibly planning our next trip somewhere in the world, tinkering with things
      I don't understand out in the garage or lately just playing around with Chrome devtools to see what
      all is possible.
